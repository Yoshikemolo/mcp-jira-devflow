  recommendation: |
    1. Start with SKILL.md for orchestration basics
    2. Load PLAN-EXAMPLES.md when creating new plans
    3. Load ROLLBACK-STRATEGIES.md when handling failures

  fallback: |
    SKILL.md contains plan structure and execution phases.
    Reference files provide detailed examples and patterns.
